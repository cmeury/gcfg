# gcfg: quick gcloud configuration switcher

**gcfg** is a very small shellscript that utilizes [fzf](https://git.io/C4FBDw)
to switch between gcloud configurations blazingly fast. :fire:

It is directly inspired by the Kubernetes namespace switcher [kns](https://github.com/blendle/kns).

## Demo
![Demo](.github/gcfgdemo.gif)

## Installation
To install **kns** you can just run this command:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmeury/gcfg/master/bin/gcfg -o /usr/local/bin/gcfg && chmod +x $_
```

That's it! Done! :raised_hands:
